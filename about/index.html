  <p class="mcol">Hi, I'm Nash Kaminski, a coterminal computer engineering student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My main motivation to study engineering is the simple fact that I like to build cool things. More specifically, I have a particular interest in computer hardware design and robotics. Additionally, I tend to be very curious as to how things work or why things occur as they do. As a result of such, I also often dabble in the field of so called reverse engineering. I am also quite well known for my knowledge and proficiency with low level programming and working with Linux. Furthermore, I am a strong supporter of open source software and personally host a mirror of Arch Linux and have made contributions to a few open source projects.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I enjoy spending a fair bit of my free time working on many cool <a href="../projects">projects</a>.</li>
      <li>Owing to my limited time as a student, I primarily work on small freelance jobs. Have a look at my <a href="../resume">resume</a>.</li>
      <li>I also run a few other Linux servers such as the <a href="/server">one that I have at home</a>, as well as <a href="https://iit.kaminski.io/">one at IIT</a>.</li>
      <li>Looking to get in touch with me? Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:nashkaminski@comcast.net">email</a>, and here is my <a href="../assets/nkaminski_pubkey.asc">PGP key</a> in case it is something private.</li>
