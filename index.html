  <p id="blink" class="mcol">Hi, I'm Nash Kaminski, a recent computer engineering graduate from the Illinois Institute of Technology currently employed by a large financial services firm. My main motivation to study engineering was the simple fact that I like to build novel and innovative things. Specifically, I have particularly strong interests in the area of digital electronics design, low-level software development, information security and Linux administration. Additionally, I tend to be very curious as to how things work or why things occur as they do. As a result of such, I also often dabble in the field of so called reverse engineering. Furthermore, I am a strong supporter of open source software and personally host a mirror of Arch Linux and have made contributions to a few notable open source projects.</p>
