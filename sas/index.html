    <h5>There are a variety of other sites and systems that I either operate or am otherwise associated with that really do not fit elsewhere into this site but I would still like to say something about.</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/server">Home Server</a>: This is the most powerful server that I own and operate from the small server room in my basement. This is system is used for a variety of both personal and work related tasks such as hosting this website, running VMs for freelance work projects, hardware simulation and software development, as well as file sharing and storage. While uptime issues are very rare, I do avoid hosting anything on this machine where a day or so of downtime is completely unacceptable.</li>
        <li><a href="https://iit.kaminski.io/">IIT Server</a>: This is a much older Dell Poweredge 2850 and IBM EXP400 setup that I own and operate in the Illinois Tech Robotics server center for almost anything that will be primarily accessed from within IIT or other universities such as my coursework repositories, ITR photo/video repositories as well as my Arch Linux mirror.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/mirror.kaminski.io/">Arch Linux Mirror</a>: This is a full mirror of the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> distrubution on my server hosted at IIT.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nkaminski/">Github Page</a>: My page on Github, used for all of my open source hardware and software development. However, since Github's last major outage, I always make sure to keep backups of all repos on one of my own machines.</li>
